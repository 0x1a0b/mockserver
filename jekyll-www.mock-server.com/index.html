<h2>What is MockServer</h2>

<p>MockServer is for mocking of any system you integrate with via HTTP or HTTPS (i.e. services, web sites, etc).</p>

<p>MockServer can:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>return a "mock" response</strong> when a request matches an expectation (<a href="/pages/mock_server/creating_expectations">see more</a>)</li>
	<li><strong>forward a request</strong> when the request matches an expectation (i.e. ack as a selective proxy) (<a href="/pages/mock_server/creating_expectations">see more</a>)</li>
	<li><strong>execute a callback</strong> (in Java) when a request matches an expectation, allowing the response to be created dynamically (<a href="/pages/mock_server/creating_expectations">see more</a>)</li>
	<li><strong>verify requests</strong> have been sent (i.e. in a test assertion) (<a href="/pages/mock_server/verification">see more</a>)</li>
	<li><strong>record requests and responses</strong> to analyse how a system behaves (<a href="#proxying">see more</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why use MockServer</h2>

<p>MockServer allows you to mock any server or service that you connect to over HTTP or HTTPS, such as a REST or RPC service. </p>

<p>This is useful in the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
	<li>testing

		<ul>
			<li>easily recreate all types of responses for HTTP dependencies such as REST or RPC services to test applications easily and affectively</li>
			<li>isolate the system under test to ensure tests run reliably and only fail when there is a genuine bug. It is important only the system under test is tested and not its dependencies to avoid tests failing due to irrelevant external changes such as network failure or a server being rebooted / redeployed.</li>
			<li>easily setup mock responses independently for each test to ensure test data is encapsulated with each test. Avoid sharing data between tests that is difficult to manage and maintain and risks tests infecting each other.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>de-coupling development

		<ul>
			<li>start working against a service API before the service is available. If an API or service is not yet fully developed MockServer can mock the API allowing any team who is using the service to start work without being delayed.</li>
			<li>isolate development teams particularly critical during the initial development phases when the APIs / services may be extremely unstable and volatile. Using MockServer allows development work to continue even when an external service fails.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>A system with service dependencies as follows:</p>

<p>Could be tested with MockServer, mocking the service dependencies, as follows:</p>
