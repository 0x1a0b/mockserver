### What is MockServer

MockServer is for mocking of any system you integrate with via HTTP or HTTPS (i.e. services, web sites, etc).

MockServer supports:

* mocking of any HTTP / HTTPS response when any request is matched ([learn more](http://www.mock-server.com/#mocking))
* recording requests and responses to analyse how a system behaves ([learn more](http://www.mock-server.com/#proxying))
* verifying which requests and responses have been sent as part of a test ([learn more](http://www.mock-server.com/#proxying))

This docker container will run an instance of the MockServer on the following ports:

* serverPort 8080
* serverSecurePort 8090
* proxyPort 9080
* proxySecurePort 9090

For information on how to use the MockServer please see http://www.mock-server.com
